# Level 4 Task 5 -OOP in PHP

## Task 1

● Create a file called student.php and in it define a UniversityStudent class with the following:

○ At least 4 attributes

○ A constructor

○ Appropriate getter-methods

○ An abstract method called get_avg_grade()

● In the same file, define a MathematicsStudent class that extends UniversityStudent with the following:

○ Two more attributes, of which one should be $avg_grade

○ Its own constructor

○ Appropriate getter and setter methods

○ Implement the abstract method from its parent.

## Task 2

Create a file called maths-form.html that contains an appropriate HTML form for all the attributes of a MathematicsStudent. 

Have it POST to a PHP script called maths-parser.php, which takes all the input information, places that in an appropriate object, and then writes that object’s details to an HTML unordered list (<ul>).

You need not do any form validation.
